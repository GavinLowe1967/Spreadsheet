Language
========

Outstanding:
-----------

- Clear boxes on reload

- EqTypeConstraint.intersection -- test **

- Parser for strings in script.  

- Improve error messages concerning polymorphic types: "val xs = head(3)" ->
  Expected List[TypeVar(133)], found Int at line 1.  Also 1:: [true]; 
  tail([1]) == tail([false])

- Allow function application where function is arbitrary expression

- Line numbers for second definitions

Current: 
--------


Soon
----
  
Lists:
- [_ .. _]
- list comprehensions

Long term
---------


* "for"s. 

* Allow type annonations in script, e.g. x = #A3 : Int

Musings
-------

Uses for TypeConstraints:
- For type parameters (TypeParamConstraint): (Num, Eq, Any)
- For Cells (Num, Cell, Singleton)
- For type parameters (more general)

When can type t1 instantiate t2?

t1              t2
Concrete type   Concrete type  Same type only
TypeVar(tid)    Concrete type  Constraint on tid includes t2
Concrete type   Type param     t1 satisfies constraint on t2
TypeVar(tid)    Type param     Constraint on tid \inter constraint on t2 nonempty
Type param      Type param     t1 = t2
ListType(tt1)   ListType(tt2)  tt1 can instantiate tt2
ListType(tt1)   Type param     ListType(tt1) satisfies constraint on t2


Behaviour
=========

Don't allow directives to overwrite user data.

Data load and save.


Appearance
----------

Index cells from 1

Code

Split evaluation tests off from PerserTest.

Tidy up TypeCheckerTest


===================================== DONE

- parser for bools in spreadsheet -- done
val b = [] == [3] fails to typecheck
val b = [3] == [] succeeds (?)


Try to allow arithmetic operators to be applied to Int and Float.  Mostly done. 

* EvaluationTypeChecker.unify -- update for equality, inequality

* Test other binary ops.  I think equality/inequality won't work yet. 


* Allow arithmetic operators to be applied to Int and Float.
def f[A <: NumType](): A = 3
[3, 5.5]
Idea: give type of an integer litteral as a new TypeVar with
NumTypeConstraint.  This nearly works.  It works for

def f[A <: Num](x: A): A = 3+x

The unification replaces the TypeVar for "3" with TypeParam("A").

But it doesn't work for

def f[A <: Num](x: A): A = x+3
def f[A <: Num](): A = 3

The unification tries to unify the TypeVar for "3" with TypeParam("A"), which
fails.

More test cases

val y = #D3; def f[A <: Num]() : A = y

I think NumTypeConstraint isn't quite the same as
MemberOf(List(IntType,FloatType)).

Allow a TypeVar to be unified with a TypeParam when the constraint on the
TypeVar is a superset of that on the TypeParam?  (The constraint on the
TypeParam implies that on the TypeVar.)  This would narrow the constraint on
the TypeVar.

With "val y = #D3; def f[A <: Num]() : A = y", #D3 must be an Int.
With "#A3 = #A1 + #A2", both #A1 and #A2 can be Int or Float.

When reading a value from a cell, if the read has typeconstraint
NumTypeConstraint:
- If cell value is Float, don't update
- If cell value Int, don't update   ????????

In Unification.unify, case (TypeVar(tId1), TypeParam(tp)) allow success only
when tp associated with NumTypeConstraint, and tId1 with a superset of that;
upade environment to map tId1 to IntType, but return type TypeParam(tp).  

* In parse errors, print relevant line, highlighting position; trim excessive
  text - done

Function declarations and applications
- parse function application -- done, but only for function names
- ensure distinct param names - static analysis
- More typenames, including in parser and ** catch incorrect types


Improve parse error messages.
-  null -- done

- polymorphism (def id[A](x: A): A = x) -- done
- type classes (def equal[A <: Eq](x: A, y: A): Boolean = x == y)
- give polymorphic types to built-in functions, head, tail 

- Num type class

* Parsing of type constraints: Eq and Num
* Type checking with constraints 
  def add[A <: Num](x: A, y: A): A = x+y
  def equal[A <: Eq](x: A, y: A) : Boolean = x == y
  def sum[A <: Num](xs: List[A]) : A = ... base case ??
- Check that all types in function declaration signatures are declared. -- done
1. In type environment, store (TypeParam => TypeConstraint) map.  -- done
2. Update when processing function declaration --done
3. Check names at same point --done
3. Remove new names when leaving scope: store previous map in Frame -- done
- When calling functions/binops, check that lower bound of each actual
  parameter is a subset of the type of the formal parameter. -- done for
  functions, I think.  But not binops
*** In TypeChecker on FunctionDeclarations: 
// if any of tparams gets bound to a TypeVar, update in typeEnv(name) -- NO
val y = #A3
def f(x: Int): Int = x+y -- seems fine
def g[A <: Num](x: A): A = x+y -- do we want this?  -- NO- Check return type param in scope -- done

- What is needed in TypeEnv at evaluation time?  constraints,
  apply(tid). typeParamMap, constraintForTypeParam, replaceEvalTime, showType
- Check names of parameters of functions are disjoint.  -- done
- check declared names are disjoint in each block. -- done
- Improve Directive.perform re error handling. -- done
- TypeT.isSubclassOf -- done
- Value.getType -- done

- Remove eval from Exp classes. and perform from Statement -- done
- Move FunctionDeclaration and FunctionApp and BlockExp -- done

- Chenage FunctionValue to encapsulate function List[Value] => Value? -- done

-- Done introduction of type parameters.  Allow their use in types of params or return value. 
- Substitution.scala. l20, FIXME

- For functions with type parameters, replace each with type variable with
  "lower bound" constraint.  (?)  No, separately record restrictions on type
  params.
- type checking for lists, from left-to-right
- empty list

- Test "==" with Cell types, find failures to match -- done

Need to allow types to be refined in TypeEnv.replace, if tId associated with another cell
Either:
1. In TypeEnv, maintain map TypeID -> List(CellExpr), update in CellExpr within replace (consider case where t is TypeVar)
2. In TypeEnv.constraints, include map to singleton type

No, 1 goes wrong, as changes to the sheet won't get propsagated.  But yes -- do 1 when typechecking, but 2 at evaluation time


-- If TypeVar(x) has SingletonTypeConstraint(TypeVar(y)), then gets updated,
   also need to update y

-- Get rid of cellReadMap - NO

(+) : Num a => (a,a) -> a; (==) : Eq a => (a,a) -> Bool; (&&) : (Bool,Bool) -> Bool, (<=) :: Num a => (a,a) -> Bool etc.  To apply to args, generate TypeVar(t) with
constraint Num.  Try to unify with types of args.  To unify concrete type with
Num, succeed if it is numeric.  To combine two constraints, take intersection.
constraints need operations 
def satisfied(t: TypeT) : Boolean
def intersection(c: Constraint): Constraint 
constraints correspond to Cell, Eq, Num
