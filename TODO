Language
========


1. Tidy up this file!

2. Allow empty blocks, "for(x <- [2]){ }"; "def f[A,B](x: A, y: B): A = x; for(if f(true, #A1)){ }" (TypeCheckerTest1, l. 218) -- done 

3. Add untyped cell reads in TopLevelTest -- done

4. Check Frames in typechecker -- store untypedCell no. -- done

5. Consider the case of "[] == [3]" and "[] = [f]" for f a function.  cf TypeEnv.isEqType, case TypeVar -- done
-- Change isEqType to return Reply[TypeEnv], in the case of TypeVar(tv),
   updating to map tv to EqTypeConstraint.  Handle in TypeChecker.typeCheckBinOp

6. Add double-write error, giving all places where written.

(a) Set CellSource when value entered, or CSV read in.  Stop
  Environment.getCell from adding source. -- done

(b) When writing to cell, add source; so there are potentially two types of
  sources, the cell the value was read from, and the script code that produced
  that value.  Set combinatiopn in Execution.perform, case Directive. -- done

(c) show in selection -- done

(d) Add double-write error

7. Add more patterns for cell match expressions, e.g. "_" or "_: Int" as
   wildcard?

8. Improve treatment of Strings:
- Allow non-quoted strings in CSV
- Think about escaped characters in non-quoted string cells.

9. Add "if" directives.

10. Haskell standard prelude


-- allow assertions, errors.

- order relations on rows, columns

- Look again at Unification.scala.  Are all branches tested?

Catch stack overflows.

Outstanding:
-----------

- Seems to need newline at end 

- EqTypeConstraint.intersection -- test **

- Parser for strings in script.  

- Improve error messages concerning polymorphic types: "val xs = head(3)" ->
  Expected List[TypeVar(133)], found Int at line 1.  Also 1:: [true]; 
  tail([1]) == tail([false])

- Allow function application where function is arbitrary expression

- Line numbers for second definitions

- Source for values in cells.

Current: 
--------

"applyToThree(doubleI)".  Needs to unify (Int => Int) against (A => B) with A
<: Num. happens It tries to unify FunctionType(List(),List(IntType),IntType)
and FunctionType(List(),List(TypeVar(3)),TypeVar(4)) with 3 ->
NumTypeConstraint, 4 -> AnyTypeConstraint


 I think we should be testing whether Int is a superset of (A <: Num). 


What happens with

def f[A <: Num](x: A): Int = { def g(y: Int): Int = 3; g(x) } ?  There it
tries to unify IntType with TypeParam A, which fails.



- Test more.  Another case not working in TypeCheckerTest "applyToThree(doubleI)"

(low priority)

- Rename TypeChecker.typeCheckListUnify, and improve comment


Soon
----
  
Lists:
- [_ .. _]
- list comprehensions

Long term
---------


* "for"s. 

* Allow type annonations in script, e.g. x = #A3 : Int

Musings
-------

Uses for TypeConstraints:
- For type parameters (TypeParamConstraint): (Num, Eq, Any)
- For Cells (Num, Cell, Singleton)
- For type parameters (more general)

When can type t1 instantiate t2?

t1              t2
Concrete type   Concrete type  Same type only
TypeVar(tid)    Concrete type  Constraint on tid includes t2
Concrete type   Type param     t1 satisfies constraint on t2
TypeVar(tid)    Type param     Constraint on tid \inter constraint on t2 nonempty
Type param      Type param     t1 = t2
ListType(tt1)   ListType(tt2)  tt1 can instantiate tt2
ListType(tt1)   Type param     ListType(tt1) satisfies constraint on t2


Behaviour
=========

Don't allow directives to overwrite user data.

Data load and save.


Appearance
----------

Index cells from 1

Code
----

Split evaluation tests off from PerserTest.

Tidy up TypeCheckerTest


===================================== DONE


1. Tidy up typechecking of cell expressions -- common code -- done
-- Tidy up ExpParser. -- done

-- Deal with missing newline at end of file. -- done

1. Remove typing of cells in some places, where the typechecker can deduce the
type.
- Initially allocate type variable to the type. -- done
- Potentially unify that type subsequently. -- done
- At the end of evaluation of the enclosing expression (the call to typeCheck 
  from typeCheckStmt), check that the type has  been decided.
- Augment type environment with list of those cell reads awaiting types. -- done
- Update Execution to handle this construct

2. Improve parser errors, e.g. when types omitted on cells.  Implement ~! -- done
- Add backtrackable field to ParseResult
- Take conjunction in ~, etc.
- Implement in |
- Implement ~!

2. Parse error with
def sumCol(c: Column, r: Row, end: Row): Int = 
  if(r == end) 0 else sumCol(c, r+1, end) + Cell(c,r) -- ok with parentheses.
1. Add cell type matching, e.g. 
 #B3 match{ case x: Int => ...; case st: String => ...; case Blank => ... }
This is a new syntactic category. 
- Define syntax -- done
- Parsing -- done
- Typechecking -- done
- Evaluation -- done

Consider typechecking of head([]) -- done

Strings:
- Store as literal - done
- To enter in script, surround with quote marks, and allow escapes -- done
- To enter in cells, same with enclosing quotes; or arbitrary not matching 
  number or boolean. -- done, but think about latter option.
- To display in cells, as literal, but use different colour. -- done, add to test
- In CSV, enclosed by quote marks, with " replaced by "" (that's the standard).
- Refactor StatementParser.scala: more number  and string1 into base class? -- done

2. Add "to" and "until" infixes to build lists. -- done
- Parsing -- done
- Type checking -- done
- Evaluation -- done

1. Don't allow overwriting of cells. -- done

3. Support saving and loading as CSV. -- mostly done, except treatment of
Strings.

4. Automate tests that load script and sheet, and checks results. -- done, but
could be extended.

for statements - done

Typechecking of "def applyToThreeF[A <: Num](f: A => A): A = f(3.0)" not
working.  Gets to call of unify(..., FloatType, TypeParam("A")), but that
fails.  ** The restriction on A seems to have been lost from the typechecker.
It's there just before the call to typeCheckListUnify.....  No!  I was using
the wrong function!  Working now

Type checking of "apply" not working -- done

- USe TypeChecker.subTypeParams in case for FunctionApp

- Also use in mkInstance. -- done

- In case for FunctionApp, replace each FunctionType by an instance using mkInstance -- done
- parser for bools in spreadsheet -- done
val b = [] == [3] fails to typecheck
val b = [3] == [] succeeds (?)


Try to allow arithmetic operators to be applied to Int and Float.  Mostly done. 

* EvaluationTypeChecker.unify -- update for equality, inequality

* Test other binary ops.  I think equality/inequality won't work yet. 


* Allow arithmetic operators to be applied to Int and Float.
def f[A <: NumType](): A = 3
[3, 5.5]
Idea: give type of an integer litteral as a new TypeVar with
NumTypeConstraint.  This nearly works.  It works for

def f[A <: Num](x: A): A = 3+x

The unification replaces the TypeVar for "3" with TypeParam("A").

But it doesn't work for

def f[A <: Num](x: A): A = x+3
def f[A <: Num](): A = 3

The unification tries to unify the TypeVar for "3" with TypeParam("A"), which
fails.

More test cases

val y = #D3; def f[A <: Num]() : A = y

I think NumTypeConstraint isn't quite the same as
MemberOf(List(IntType,FloatType)).

Allow a TypeVar to be unified with a TypeParam when the constraint on the
TypeVar is a superset of that on the TypeParam?  (The constraint on the
TypeParam implies that on the TypeVar.)  This would narrow the constraint on
the TypeVar.

With "val y = #D3; def f[A <: Num]() : A = y", #D3 must be an Int.
With "#A3 = #A1 + #A2", both #A1 and #A2 can be Int or Float.

When reading a value from a cell, if the read has typeconstraint
NumTypeConstraint:
- If cell value is Float, don't update
- If cell value Int, don't update   ????????

In Unification.unify, case (TypeVar(tId1), TypeParam(tp)) allow success only
when tp associated with NumTypeConstraint, and tId1 with a superset of that;
upade environment to map tId1 to IntType, but return type TypeParam(tp).  

* In parse errors, print relevant line, highlighting position; trim excessive
  text - done

Function declarations and applications
- parse function application -- done, but only for function names
- ensure distinct param names - static analysis
- More typenames, including in parser and ** catch incorrect types


Improve parse error messages.
-  null -- done

- polymorphism (def id[A](x: A): A = x) -- done
- type classes (def equal[A <: Eq](x: A, y: A): Boolean = x == y)
- give polymorphic types to built-in functions, head, tail 

- Num type class

* Parsing of type constraints: Eq and Num
* Type checking with constraints 
  def add[A <: Num](x: A, y: A): A = x+y
  def equal[A <: Eq](x: A, y: A) : Boolean = x == y
  def sum[A <: Num](xs: List[A]) : A = ... base case ??

2. Update when processing function declaration --done
3. Check names at same point --done
3. Remove new names when leaving scope: store previous map in Frame -- done
- When calling functions/binops, check that lower bound of each actual
  parameter is a subset of the type of the formal parameter. -- done for
  functions, I think.  But not binops
*** In TypeChecker on FunctionDeclarations: 
// if any of tparams gets bound to a TypeVar, update in typeEnv(name) -- NO
val y = #A3
def f(x: Int): Int = x+y -- seems fine
def g[A <: Num](x: A): A = x+y -- do we want this?  -- NO- Check return type param in scope -- done

- What is needed in TypeEnv at evaluation time?  constraints,
  apply(tid). typeParamMap, constraintForTypeParam, replaceEvalTime, showType
- Check names of parameters of functions are disjoint.  -- done
- check declared names are disjoint in each block. -- done

-- Done introduction of type parameters.  Allow their use in types of params or return value. 
- Substitution.scala. l20, FIXME

- For functions with type parameters, replace each with type variable with
  "lower bound" constraint.  (?)  No, separately record restrictions on type
  params.
- type checking for lists, from left-to-right
- empty list
All commented out tests in ParserTest, chck fail typechecking

Need to allow types to be refined in TypeEnv.replace, if tId associated with another cell
Either:
1. In TypeEnv, maintain map TypeID -> List(CellExpr), update in CellExpr within replace (consider case where t is TypeVar)
2. In TypeEnv.constraints, include map to singleton type

No, 1 goes wrong, as changes to the sheet won't get propsagated.  But yes -- do 1 when typechecking, but 2 at evaluation time


-- If TypeVar(x) has SingletonTypeConstraint(TypeVar(y)), then gets updated,
   also need to update y

-- Get rid of cellReadMap - NO

- Cell type - in progress; do binOps
- Improve errors in TypeChecker.unify
- Test captured variables are uncaptured - done
- Tidy up TypeEnv - add functions - done
- BlockExp - done
- Better error message in unify.fail for TypeVar -- done
- correct BlockExpr type checking -- done

(+) : Num a => (a,a) -> a; (==) : Eq a => (a,a) -> Bool; (&&) : (Bool,Bool) -> Bool, (<=) :: Num a => (a,a) -> Bool etc.  To apply to args, generate TypeVar(t) with
constraint Num.  Try to unify with types of args.  To unify concrete type with
Num, succeed if it is numeric.  To combine two constraints, take intersection.
constraints need operations 
def satisfied(t: TypeT) : Boolean
def intersection(c: Constraint): Constraint 
constraints correspond to Cell, Eq, Num
